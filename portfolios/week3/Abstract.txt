In this week's portfolio, you can find the following:

- RICE: My typical RICE report

- Text: My notes on the text and videos this week

- Code: This week for my code, I built upon last weeks code that made lacrosse teams of even numbers and positions. I started by removing all inline def statements from my functions and replacing them with let statements. This made my previous code a lot cleaner. I then created an evolutionary algorithm to make the best possible lacrosse teams given previous teams and calculating the conflicts, similarly to Prof. Spector's RICE group generation code (which I used as a guide to make mine).

In this week's portfolio, you can find the following:

- RICE: My typical RICE report is found in the file 'RICE.txt'

- Text: My notes on the text and videos this week, as well as future project ideas, is found in 'Text.txt'

- Code: My code this week is in the file 'teams.clj'. I built upon last weeks code that made lacrosse teams of even numbers and positions. 
I started by removing all inline def statements from my functions and replacing them with let statements. 
This made my previous code a lot cleaner. I then created an evolutionary algorithm to make the best possible lacrosse teams given 
previous teams and calculating the conflicts, similarly to Prof. Spector's RICE group generation code 
(which I used as a guide to make mine).

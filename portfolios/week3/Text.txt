I found all of the readings interesting this past week, especially the paper written by Professor Spector on the Evolution of AI. 
It was really interesting how the article was written in 2006, but foreshadows a lot of developments that actually took place. 
In addition, there are a lot of parallels to the evolution of evolution that we are seeing now and what was discussed over a decade ago. 
Below you can find my notes on the reading:
- Darwinian based evolutionary processes can help to shape developments in AI
- There are some who still holdout and don't believe in the darwinian based approach
- There have been great advancements in evolutionary algorithms (and even more so I can imagine in the time since publication)
- "the prevailing assumption that general artificial intelligence can only be (or should only be) designed by intelligent human designers is flawed and should be rejected"

I also found the video on Learning Classifier Systems really helpful. 
The video gave a good description about LCSes and some use cases. 
Find my notes below:
- Type of evolutionary algorithm
- Generated and evaluated on fitness score
- Reproduction --> combine parts of old classifiers to make new ones (like in genetic evolution)
- Good for noisy data

Finally, I found the "Evolutionary music: applying evolutionary computation to the art of creating music," reading particularly interesting.
I thought that the idea of using a genetic algorithm to produce rhythms and melodies was really cool. I think music offers a lot of potential for evolutionary algorithms,
as there is a great deal of room for artistic expression and openness. There have been an increasing number of "AI Generated Music" videos that I have seen in social media recently.
Some of these videos have even resulted in AI generated artists being signed to music labels and gaining a large influx of followers.

After reading these articles and watching the video, I have a few ideas on future projects:
- Generate a sort of maze game and then use a genetic algorithm to find the best path to the end
- Playing around with the Game of Life and genetic algorithms

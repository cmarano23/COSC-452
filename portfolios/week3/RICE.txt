Who: Andrew Ni, William DeGroot Carson Marano
When: 2/21 at 7PM
Where: Zoom
What: 
- Andrew: Andrew was working on the traveling salesmen code, but did not finish before Prof. Spector  showed his example. He is currently exploring new ideas and going to find a way to incorporate his existing code into something new.
- William: William is working on a graph theory problem. He mentioned how he is trying to incorporate a genetic algorithm to try and help solve the problems.
- Carson: Last week, I wrote code to split a lacrosse team into even numbers randomly by position. This week, I built off of that by cleaning up my code to remove inline def statements and replace them with lets, and also added in an evolutionary algorithm aspect based on Prof. Spector's RICE group code.

We also had a side discussion about Prof. Spector's essay on AI and how it is relevant with the release of Chat GPT and other competing AI chatbots. In addition, we helped each other through some code relating to evolutionary algorithms and specifically genetic algorithms	.

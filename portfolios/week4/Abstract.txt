In this week's portfolio, you can find the following:

- RICE: My typical RICE report is found in the file 'RICE.txt'

- Text: All of my notes on the readings this week, as well as some future project ideas, is found in 'Text.txt'

- Code: My code this week is in the file 'shifts.clj'. I created a new program that set out to create an ideal work schedule based on availability times of the employees. 
I was able to make the program work for a map of 6 employees, but have now run into trouble when expanding to 12 employees. 
I was able to trace back the source of my error to my 'mutate' function, which I wrote to swap all times with multiple people booked with the time of another schedule. 
The issue with this function is that it only takes two schedules, and doesn't handle more than two.
When I try to run an evolve function, I run into an issue because of the limitations of my mutate.

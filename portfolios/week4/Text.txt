Find below my notes on readings:

Automatic Quantum Computer Programming: A Genetic Programming Approach Chapter 5
- The beginning of the chapter details what programming by genetic algorithms really entails, and how it uses the foundation of biology and darwinism to form computer programs
- Genetic programming is basically an "automatic programming system"
- You feed into a genetic program what you want it to do and some data to do it
- The chapter then goes in to discuss different standard genetic programming mutations
- Walks through symbolic regression

geneticprogramming.com
- Really interesting website with tons of resources on genetic programming
- Has resources for tree-based GP, Stack-based GP, Linear GP, Cartesian GP, and many more
- Offers a brief history of Genetic Programming
- Software section discusses ways to implement GP (like Clojure)

Future project ideas after reading Bibliography on GP:
- Cellular automata rules using GP (http://web.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~sakama/papers/jca07.pdf)
- Generating Mazes with GP (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9122338)
- Interesting Project: Using GP to play RTS video games (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5286453)

This week, I completed the following tasks:
- Met and discussed lingering syntax and data structures questions with my RICE group
- Created working code that will split one lacrosse team into two even teams with an equal number of position groups on each team
- I did a lot of problems on the '4ever-clojure' website
- Read the wikipedia page on Genetic Algorithms
- Read Chapter 4 of Clojure for the Brave and True

All in all, I found this to be a very productive week. Coming into it, I was really struggling with how to best use maps and 'let' functions. I was able to incorporate these into my makeTeams code and feel far more familiar with them.

I really found the readings and videos interesting, especially the Ted Talk. After taking Machine Learning last semester, I was familiar with some of the topics discussed regarding evolutionary computation. I'd love to continue and explore some of the topics touched on in Machine Learning and trying to implement some of my past projects from python to Clojure. Obviously these won't be direct translations, but I think it would be a good challenge and would serve me well in learning Clojure.

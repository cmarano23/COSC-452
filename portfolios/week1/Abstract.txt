This week, I focused on working with Clojure and messing around with functions and other variables. I attempted to make a blackjack game in Clojure, but kept running into issues concerning get nil values for the user score. I tried to work around this issue and got close to having it work, but I just can't get it. Other than that, I made functions for getting the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and then a function to calculate the orbital period of a planet using the semi-major axis length. I used a lot of functions from the Java Math library.

Since there were no assigned readings / texts for this week, I primarily focused on doing research for final project ideas revolving around 1D cellular automata. I came up with a few ideas based on the topics discussed in this paper https://melaniemitchell.me/PapersContent/evca-review.pdf. One of the topics I am considering is to develop an algorithm that, given the last rows of a cellular automata, could determine the initial configuration to a reasonable metric (say >75% accuracy. Another idea is to possibly evolve a current cellular automata to replicate a different rule by changing only a small amount of cells. I think the latter of the two would take significantly longer though and possibly not be able to finish in time for the end of the semester.

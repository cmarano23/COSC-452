Below, find some notes on readings this past week. All in all, the discussion / videos on push / propel / propeller were really interesting but a bit confusing to be honest.

Propel and Propeller readme: 
- Interesting concept and evolution from push
- A little bit confused about differences between the two
- Seems like propel is just a fork of Tom Helmuth's little Push GP implementation in Clojure
- Would be interesting to think of project applications with Propeller

An Even Quicker Introduction to the Push Programming Language:
- Helps to clear up some confussion
- Makes understanding push a lot easier when you get to walk through it here
- Stack based

Online Push Interpreter:
- Really cool to be able to go through step by step
- confusing to use from a human perspective, but I suppose thats why its supposed to be utilized by the computer

Project Ideas:
- I've been really thinking about how I can use evolution and GP to solve or understand cellular automata and I think one project idea could be to use these things to resolve what rule has been outputted and followed by the cellular automata.

In this week's portfolio, you can find the following:

- RICE: My typical RICE report is found in the file 'RICE.txt'

- Text: All of my notes on the readings this week, as well as some future project ideas, is found in 'Text.txt'

- Code: My code this week is split between two files: 'shifts.clj' and 'cell.clj'. In 'shifts.clj', I was able to fix the error that I was receiving last week and developed three different evolution models with various changes between them. By changing aspects of the mutate function, I was able to make that work with a full set of schedules being read in. I then made three evolution models: 1) old-evolve which was based on the old-mutate function of the RICE group code 2) evolve which sorts the schedules then performs mutations on best two 3) random-evolve which uses random tournament selection to pick schedules and then mutate. Random-evolve was found to be the best because it never got caught in repetitive loops of any kind.
The other file, 'cell.clj', is an implementation of cellular automata in Clojure. The program works by asking the user for a rule number, a number of rows to print, and the number of cells per row and then outputs the cellular automata based on these specifications. I am hoping to build off of this code in the future to incorporate	some sort of evolutionary algorithm into it.

In this week's portfolio, I really focused a lot of effort into doing research into papers regarding cellular automata and genetic programming. I read 3 different papers closely to try and understand how they were building their genetic algorithms and what they were applying them to in an effort to try and replicate it. Below you can find a recap of each file:

- RICE: My typical RICE report is found in the file 'RICE.txt'

- Text: All of my notes on the readings this week, as well as the papers that I read on Cellular Automata, is found in 'Text.txt'

- Code: In cell.clj, I built upon my code from last week to make a few new functions that introduce genetic programing to figure out the rule number of a cellular automata. I created a new function 'getCellularAutomataHard' which is a hard coded form of 'getCellularAutomata' which allows for use in my GP functions. I also created a fitness function called 'getFitness' which works by taking in a cellular automata and checking the last row, then it would sum up the number of 1's in that row, and then compare those number of 1's to the number of 1's in a given rule. For example, if a row had 15 1's in the last row, and a rule had 17, then the fitness of this CA would be 0.88 (15/17). Each fitness value ranges on scale of 0-1. I also created a crossover function which swaps the row of two CA's to be used in the evolution. Finally, I got halfway through my evolve function 'figureOutRuleWithEvo' which determines which rule you have given it using evolution and crossover based on the fitness values. I just have to figure out and finish the last part of this evolution function.
